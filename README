I followed the instructions from here:

Using libvirt hooks will allow us to automatically run scripts before the VM is started and after the VM has stopped.

/etc/libvirt/hooks
├── qemu <- The script that does the magic
└── qemu.d
    └── {VM Name}
        ├── prepare
        │   └── begin
        │       └── start.sh
        └── release
            └── end
                └── revert.sh

Anything in the directory /etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu.d/{VM Name}/prepare/begin will run when starting your VM

Anything in the directory /etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu.d/{VM Name}/release/end will run when your VM is stopped
